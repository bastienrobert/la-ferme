# La Ferme

## Install

Check **README.md** in both packages:

- [client](packages/client/README.md)
- [server](packages/server/README.md)

## Getting started

Use **yarn** as package manager. Then:

```
yarn
```

Launch the application using:

```
yarn dev
```

Or use your device as debugger using the **xcworkspace** and start the server only:

```
yarn server
```

Server and iOS simulator should open.
